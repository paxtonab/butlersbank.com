    The Waves, Sea Shells and Coral Vase is raised from a round sheet of silver, a round bottom transforms up to a square rim with subtle compound and convex changes. Following those contours waves are flat chased starting at the bottom in a crisp tight pattern and breaking up as they migrate through realistically chased and repoussed shells and coral. The whole is a meditation on movement and texture capturing a moment in nature.
