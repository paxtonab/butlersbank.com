    The Elephant Baby Cup has an elephant head with the ears, trunk and tusks of a mature African elephant as the handle. Four feet and a tail complete this majestic animal. Meant to be used functionally, this baby cup is designed to evolve with the vagaries of a child's touch; each use presents an opportunity for the child to leave their personal imprint, transforming the polished silver surface into a bespoke version of the elephant's hide. As the child grows, so too will the history captured in the elephant's silver 'skin,' ensuring that the cup not only serves a functional purpose but also becomes a living chronicle of childhood moments.
