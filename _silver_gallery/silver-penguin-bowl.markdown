    Five penguins on an iceberg form the decorative elements for this bowl. The emperor penguin stands above the four noisy little Adeles, they all are on a chased iceberg base that has a different flat chased ice crystal pattern on each face of the ice. The top of the ice inside the bowls with the emperor penguin can be removed and the bowl can also be taken off the bottom of the iceberg. A plate with an inscription commemorating the occasion the bowl was given forms the base of the iceberg.
