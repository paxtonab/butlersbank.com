    The Mouse and Cheese knife is crafted from lost wax carving and casting combined with a hand forged blade. It is balanced and surprisingly ergonomic. The three mice are modeled with unique characteristics. One is standing, one is sitting and the last is "stuck" in a hole in the cheese. This whimsical interpretation of a traditional cheese knife pays homage to functionality while making the observer think of themselves as mice getting into the cheese.
