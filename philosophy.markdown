<h3>Silver Repairs & Appraisals</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.silversmithing.com/artisan-members.htm" target="_blank">Society of American Silversmiths</a> recognizes Robert A. Butler as one of their senior members, and as an expert in the fields of 19th and 18th century English and American silver. This knowledge is in high demand as Butler has served as an advisor for many estates and private collections, including the <a href="http://www.mfa.org/node/9482" target="_blank">Boston Museum of Fine Artâ€™s English Silver Collection</a>.</p>
<p>Butler has repaired the work of many world famous silversmiths, including makers from as early as the 17th century. Butler has experience with English, French, American, Italian, Dutch, Scandinavian and later German silversmiths.  The most notable makers include Nelme, De LaMarie, Storr, Revere, Forbes, Gorham, Tiffany, Heinrich, Stone and Jensen.</p>
<p>Using traditional techniques and a lifetime of experience, Butler completes all repairs to museum standards, with the goal of restoring the piece as closely to its original making as possible.</p>
